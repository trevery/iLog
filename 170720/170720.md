## iThink

Last night, Jiahui and I reinstalled system on MacBookPro in order to fresh this computer. But the speed of downloading this system lasted for a whole night. So, we have to config the computer today. 

We spend a long time to fix the problem that the macOS system is too old to update to the newest one. After we finished it. We wanna make a backup for the new system. However, I erased our WD-Disk when i plan to part it. That means i lost all my data which witnessed my last three years' life. 

But, When i lost my data, i feel not sad any more, actually, i feel so happy that everything of my history is gone. And all i have are just now and future. It makes me relax.

I think i shoud delete my 'data' regularly. People is just like a pot. When your pot is full. It's hard for you to put fresh things in.
