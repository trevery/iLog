## iLife

Today, Jiahui went home. I sent her to North Sqare, Chongqing North Train Station. The weather is so hot, we had to go there by taxi. After going back, I took my plan to clear my room. It was a mass. I also had a course in the afternoon, so i haven't had a nap. Now I clearn it up, and sit on my desk, writting this diary, feeling a little tired. 

I think, having a brand new beginning is a good thing. And it's also good for archive my past life, and set out for the new future. But I find that my things are too many, so it's hard for me to archive them in boxes. Actually, I have already about 30 boxes, and there also having somethings out of boxes. I feel not happy. 

So, I plan to make some rules for myself, in order to prevent too much unnecessary things to swallow my life space. 

1. keep work place clean and simple.
2. Think twice before buying something, is it my necessary need? Have i had something can replace it?
3. cast unnecessary things away, keep things' number under 200.
