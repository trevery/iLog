## iPaper

It take my two days to write  Business Model course paper.

## iFriends

When I finished my paper, I found myself having no communication of my teachers. And, my cute teaching assistant seemed too busy. So I asked  the QQ group for help. At the beginning, there was no one answering me. I felt a little nervous, because this was my last day in school. Tomorrow, I will head myself towards ShenZhen. There will be a contest. But, I believed there will be an answer. Soon, A girl called Huang Rong, gave me an screenshoot contains our teachers E-mail.

I felt happy, and thanked this girl.

> "Thanksï¼Œcute sister."

She didn't answer me, until I answered another boy's questation. Maybe she didn't seen before.

> "No thanks, cute brother."

Her words aroused my curiosity. I sent a picture describe awkward. Then I tried to add her QQ number. Soon, I got her permission. 

We talked about many topics. She loves poems. I promised her I will send her a anthology of poems in order to express my heartful thanks. At the beginning, I  ask her for address to sent her watermelon using Meituan service. But She didn't say yes. But when I said I will sent her a book, she said yes without vacillating. It's interesting. I don't know why. Maybe, I guess, people think book is pure and meaningful, but takeaways are shot of meanings.

We talked until night. I asked her call me up tomorrow, because I am afraid i will be late for my train. She always gets up early. So I think she will agree my asks. She agreed.

I feel happy talking with her. Maybe we can become good friends. She majors in Computer Science, which is my interesting major.
