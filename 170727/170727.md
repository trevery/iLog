Yesterday afternoon, I met my friend Cai Lang. He asked my if he can borrow my guitar to practice for preparing teaching somebody. I told him to fetch it after my class. About 10 p.m. He knocked at my door, I forgot this things and i was surprise seeing him after opening the door. But after a little time, I remembered he's ask. 

He, however, didn't take my guitar away, because we plan to pracitce it together tomorror morning. I think it's a good idea, which can wake my up early, although it cost some time.

This morning, I woke up at 7:26, and I have no time to take a shower. So, I changed my close, went breakfast with him. We planed to buy a music score desk. But when we went through the underground passage between A and B area. We foud that the musical shop hasn't been open. 

The weather was so hat, and i remembered weather station has released the Red Alert about hot tempreture. We felt a little  disappointed, but we immediately went back to fetch our guitars and carry out our plan. 

We have a nice morning even though at the beginning, weather is hot. He taught me some basic music theory and help me find my top high pitch, practice my vocalization. He sang with playing guitar. It souded amazing. Playing guitar is fun, even though I felt a little dizzy beacuse my brain lacks air when I practice my voice hard.

Hope, we will keep enjoying practicing guitar. He also taught me that it's good to do something exercise outside, breathing fresh air and return to nature.
