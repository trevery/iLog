I wrote my python course home work. Coding is fun, because when your codes come alive, everything is brightly.

Reviewing my course about Ironmaking or Steelmaking is boring, I plan to try my best to zip time of reviewing them. If i can zip 3 minites from these course, 3 minites can be used for anything else, even sleeping.
