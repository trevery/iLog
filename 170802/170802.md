& strange passengers

## iFriends

Huan Rong called me at 5:35. Thanks to this call, I arrived at train station in time. I realized I set a wrong clock, which called me at 6:40. Maybe I will late for this train without her call. 

Yesterday, I recorded a song Lan Lianhua, and sent it to her. These days I practiced this song for a long time. But it also has something awkward.

## iLife

I eat something as my breakfast in the McDonald's. But I feel hangury now, especially people around me are eating their instant noodles. I wanna have a lunch.
